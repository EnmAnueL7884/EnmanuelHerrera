<h1>WHO AM I?</h1>
<p>I am just a Junior WebDeveloper  who loves programming, and since i wrote my  first line of code i fell in love with Web Development.
    I really love music, especially when i am studying or doing something, and i really want to become a successful WebDeveloper eventually, even tho
    i still need  a lot of practice and experience in order to step even further on my jurney. Currently i am a Junior developer for the nonprofit
     organization <strong>CodedByKids</strong>, which is a great organization  which i really appreciate. This organization primary goal is to teach people
    how to code.</p>
